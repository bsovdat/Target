## Overview

"Target" is a game that challenges players to shoot and destroy a target. The game mechanics are simple yet engaging - the more accurate your shot, the more damage you do. As you hone your skills, you can achieve higher levels of destruction and enjoy the satisfaction of perfect aim.

This game is built upon a simpler version developed by Tim Kmecl. We've expanded on the original concept to create an immersive and more challenging experience.

## Gameplay

- **Objective**: Destroy the target with precise shots.
- **Scoring**: Damage is calculated based on the accuracy of your shot. The closer you are to the center, the higher the damage.
